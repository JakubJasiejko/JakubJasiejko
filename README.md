# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at the West Pomeranian University of Technology with a passion for 3D printing, particularly focusing on printing with flexible materials.

### About Me

I am an enthusiast of 3D printing, and I am fascinated by the versatility of this technology. My main focus lies in 3D printing with flexible materials, enabling me to create functional and flexible objects for various applications. In my repository, you will find projects, experiments, and many other interesting things related to this field.

### Interest in 3D Printer Design, Repair, and Modifications

One of my main interests in the field of 3D printing is the design and repair of 3D printers. I believe that understanding their operation and the ability to make modifications are the keys to discovering new perspectives and improving the quality of my projects. My repositories contain various projects related to optimizing printers, their mechanics, and electronics.

### Building Mechatronic Devices using Arduino Platform

Besides 3D printing, I am involved in constructing mechatronic devices based on the Arduino platform. Arduino offers vast possibilities for creating interactive and automated devices, and I strive to utilize it in various projects. My repository includes code, schematics, and documentation related to my mechatronic endeavors.

### Collaboration and Open Source

I invite you to collaborate on my projects, provide feedback and suggestions, and share your ideas. Open source is a fundamental aspect for me as it allows us to grow together and share knowledge.
